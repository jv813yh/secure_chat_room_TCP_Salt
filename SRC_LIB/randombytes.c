/**
* Compiling any code using tweetnacl.c and tweetnacl.h results in an error 
* that there is no definition of the randombytes function.
* Searching the few available links I discover that the randombytes function is
* called to obtain a random sequence of bytes a buffer. 
* 
* It's routine that works on both windows and linux using the OS's own 
* methods for doing this. If the OS specific method fails it falls back
* to using built in C functions. 
* This is not ideal as it uses the current time as a seed to the random 
* number generator. 
* This could be discovered by brute force, but it is better than nothing. 
* So now I have a randombytes.c file that now allows clean 
* compilation of code using tweetnacl.
